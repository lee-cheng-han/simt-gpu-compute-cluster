# Verification plan

The software-tool release uses Python unit tests for encoding, round trips, diagnostics, and
the generated ISA binding, plus black-box C++ emulator tests for arithmetic,
predication, uniform and divergent branches, aligned memory, vector-add
semantics, exit, illegal instructions, and SIMT-stack overflow/underflow.
Seeds must be printed for randomized tests. `make test` is the
single regression entry point.

`docs/requirements_traceability.md` is the closure index. Each normative
requirement must name its RTL owner, directed test, assertion or formal property,
coverage point, and status. A blank field is an explicit verification gap, not an
implicit waiver.

Later modules require self-checking unit tests and assertions before integration.
The closure matrix covers every opcode/register/predicate/lane/warp; RAW and
multi-cycle completion; active-mask categories and nested divergence; shared and
scratchpad conflict degree/broadcast; memory-tracker occupancy; scheduler-ready
counts; Wishbone backpressure; completion collisions; barrier order; and every
fault. Crosses are opcode×mask,
opcode×dependency, scheduler×ready count, memory×coalescing, branch×divergence,
and shared operation×conflict. RTL traces will be compared at first mismatch with
the emulator's PC, instruction, masks, writes, memory, stack, and fault events.

The decoder unit test exercises every allocated opcode, signed
immediate extraction, all output metadata classes, a reserved opcode, and a
representative violation of each canonical-field rule. It runs as a compiled
SystemVerilog simulation through `make rtl-test`; XSim separately compiles and
elaborates the same decoder and testbench through `make xsim-smoke`.

The replicated vector-register-file test initializes and reads all 64 logical
warp/register addresses across all eight lane banks. It checks two independent
read addresses, complementary partial masks, inactive-lane preservation,
same-cycle forwarding on both ports, forwarding rejection for a different warp,
invalid-read behavior, and the per-lane replica-write assertions.

The predicate-register-file test covers all 16 warp/predicate addresses, all
eight lane bits, full and complementary partial masks, absence of forwarding,
concurrent-write isolation, invalid reads, reset recovery, masked-write assertions,
and unmasked-lane preservation assertions.

The integer-lane/vector-ALU test covers every arithmetic, logic, shift,
comparison, movement, selection, special-register, branch, and memory-address
operation. It explicitly checks two's-complement `MIN`/`MAX`/comparisons,
low-32-bit multiply, five-bit shift amounts, immediate sign extension, inactive
output suppression, predicate inversion and gating, `SEL` on every active lane,
write masks, unsupported operations, and vector address/store-data generation.

The instruction-fetch test programs every memory word, checks sequential fetch,
multi-cycle downstream stalls, stable response data, redirects, final-word
execution, sequential and launch-time range faults, sticky fault reporting,
software clear, restart, and halt. An assertion rejects ambiguous simultaneous
programming and fetching of the same instruction word.

The writeback test covers buffered backpressure, complete payload stability,
GPR-only and predicate-only commits, lane-mask preservation, simultaneous
drain/refill, flush cancellation, and empty-mask suppression. Assertions ensure
that stalled payloads remain stable and that empty architectural writes cannot
reach either register file.

The completion-queue test transports the complete canonical tagged record and
covers empty/one/full occupancy, prolonged output backpressure, FIFO ordering,
simultaneous drain/refill, ring-pointer wraparound, and flush cancellation.
Assertions check occupancy bounds, valid record tags, and complete payload
stability while stalled. Three instantiated sources, arbitration, and end-to-end
conservation remain integration-level obligations.

Before synthesis freeze, static verification closes RTL lint, CDC, reset-domain
crossings, reset deassertion, and interactions among functional, host, scan, and
BIST clocks. Every reported crossing and exception receives a documented review.

The merge CI gate runs ISA-generation consistency, Python assembler/disassembler
tests, C++ emulator tests, RTL lint, Verilator unit tests, selected integrated
programs, first-mismatch trace comparison, documentation consistency, and diff
format checks from a clean checkout. Large XSim, formal, synthesis, DFT, and
physical jobs may run on schedules or explicit release triggers.
